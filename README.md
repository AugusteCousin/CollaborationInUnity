Project Needle, for IEVA (Master SIIA)
By Auguste Cousin
Unity v2019.3.0f6, Mac build.

This project is a collaboration mini-game using photon on Unity.

The game shows a red needle and two balls on each side.

The two players need to interact with the balls in order to move them, the needle will always stay between the two balls.

Press B when your cursor is colliding with one of the balls.

The two players must then collaborate to bring the needle to collide with the balloons.

When all the balloons are popped, the players win.
